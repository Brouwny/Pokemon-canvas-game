# Pokemon-canvas-game
Hello people, I'm new to programming and GitHub as well... So I hope I'll do this the right way. I'm busy making a Pokemon canvas game for a school assignment. Unfortunately I got a bit stuck... My idea is to add 1 monster (=Meowth) when 10 treasures are caught (=Pokeball). Also I need the amount of monsters to reset to 1 when the game is over or reset.
